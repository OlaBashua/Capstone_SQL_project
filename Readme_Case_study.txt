  #  **Capstone Project for Intellipaat SQL Certification**

##  **Project Aim and tasks**
The project involved analyzing a large dataset to derive insights about customers, sales, profits, marketing expenses, and other factors. The dataset consisted of three key tables: Fact.csv file, Product.csv file, and Location.csv file. 
The **primary** tasks involved working extensively with various SQL queries, functions, and operations on the dataset and required effective utilization 
and understanding using a structured database and entity relationship diagram to successfully analyze information about states, product types, marketing spending, 
sales, profits, expenses, and more. The project aimed to extract meaningful insights from the data to support decision-making.

I effectively applied a comprehensive range of technical skills(Data Handling, Query writing, Data exploration), including SQL queries, joins, unions, subqueries, 
common table expressions(CTEs), Stored procedures, set operations, aggregate and window functions, and more, to successfully address each task in the project.
This allowed me to derive meaningful insights from the dataset, showcasing my proficiency in database management and SQL analysis.
